**Current Work:** Borderless Auth — decode-only Bearer (no JWT_SECRET); apply Prisma migration; better-auth env; E2E needs Docker

## Recent Decisions (Last 60 days)

### AD-014: Decode Borderless Bearer without signature verify (2026-07-23)

**Decision:** Remove `BORDERLESS_JWT_SECRET`. Express uses `jwt.decode` on the Borderless `accessToken`, rejects missing identity claims / expired `exp`, then upserts local `User` by `externalId`.  
**Reason:** Borderless confirmed they do not share a JWT secret; contract is only `POST /api/auth/signin` → use `accessToken` as Bearer.  
**Trade-off:** Tokens are not cryptographically authenticated by this API until Borderless documents introspect/`me`.  
**Impact:** `BorderlessAccessTokenParser`, env schema, test helpers.  
**Spec:** `.specs/features/borderless-better-auth/`

### AD-013: Borderless Bearer + better-auth on Next (2026-07-23)

**Decision:** Replace local JWT auth with better-auth on Next.js that calls Borderless `POST /api/auth/signin`. Express accepts only Borderless `accessToken` as Bearer; local `User` upserted by `externalId` (Int FKs preserved). Remove local signup/login/refresh/password-reset. Login-only UI.  
**Reason:** Single identity source (Borderless); product is a Borderless Coding surface.  
**Trade-off:** No in-app signup/reset until Borderless documents them; no refresh — expiry forces re-login; overturns “avoid migrating auth” spirit of AD-009 while keeping Int FKs.  
**Impact:** FE better-auth + credentials plugin; BE decode-only Bearer parser + user sync; Prisma `externalId`, nullable `password`, drop `RefreshToken`.  
**Spec:** `.specs/features/borderless-better-auth/spec.md`  
**Context:** `.specs/features/borderless-better-auth/context.md`

### AD-012: Interview speech-to-text via AssemblyAI batch + port (2026-07-21)

**Decision:** Mic on Practice + Review session composers; record ≤1 min → confirm Transcribe → `POST /api/transcribe` (Bearer + AI rate limit by userId) → append text to draft. Language detection only (`pt`/`en`). Sync poll in API (1.5s / 60s). AssemblyAI isolated behind `ISpeechToText` (or equivalent) port + adapter + factory.  
**Reason:** Closer to real interview answers; keep FE free of provider secrets; swap provider later without route/contract churn.  
**Trade-off:** Request held open during poll (acceptable for ≤1 min audio); no streaming partials; local EN/PT STT strings only (not full app i18n).  
**Impact:** New backend module/route, env `ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY`, FE MediaRecorder UX on shared composer.  
**Spec:** `.specs/features/interview-speech-to-text/spec.md`  
**Context:** `.specs/features/interview-speech-to-text/context.md`

### AD-011: Async review items via BullMQ (same worker) (2026-07-09)

**Decision:** Final interview turn finishes conversation (`isFinished`) and enqueues review-item extraction on a dedicated BullMQ queue processed by existing `src/worker.ts`; session exposes `reviewGenerationStatus` (`idle|pending|ready|failed`). Overturns sync generate-then-finish and prior `ICF-DEC-01` limbo behavior.  
**Reason:** Last-turn latency, limbo sessions on LLM failure, align with resume async pattern for production.  
**Trade-off:** Eventual consistency for review list; FE must poll/handle pending; slightly more surface area (status + queue).  
**Impact:** `InterviewStreamService` finish path, Prisma session columns, new queue + worker handler, session API + SSE meta, FE poll + retry endpoint.  
**Spec:** `.specs/features/async-review-items-generation/spec.md`  
**Design:** `.specs/features/async-review-items-generation/design.md`

### AD-010: Interview locale preference on User + body enum for prompts (2026-07-09)

**Decision:** `User.interviewLocale` (`en` | `pt`, nullable) for preference; create/stream require allowlisted `interviewLocale`; const map builds end-of-system-prompt language block; session column stores completion locale for metrics.  
**Reason:** Avoid prompt injection from free-text language; avoid per-turn User reads; keep UI i18n separate later.  
**Trade-off:** FE must always send locale on create/stream; mid-session change relies on next request body, not DB.  
**Impact:** Auth payload, new PATCH endpoint, Prisma on User + InterviewSession + ReviewSession, five prompt builders, FE selector on `/practice` and `/study`.  
**Spec:** `.specs/features/interview-locale/spec.md`

### AD-009: Use existing `Int` user IDs (not UUID) for FK columns (2026-05-27)

**Decision:** Aligns with current Prisma `User` model; avoids migration of auth layer.  
**Reason:** Brownfield auth.  
**Trade-off:** Entity PKs remain UUID; user FKs stay Int.  
**Impact:** All interview/resume FKs use Int `userId`.

### AD-008: Resume/session/message/review entity IDs use UUID (2026-05-27)

**Decision:** UUID PKs for interview domain entities.  
**Reason:** Matches LangGraph `thread_id` requirement.  
**Trade-off:** Mixed Int/UUID ID strategy.  
**Impact:** Session ids are UUID strings in API paths.

## Lessons Learned

### L-005: Parallel Execute agents racing git commit (2026-07-21)

**Context:** Interview STT Phase 2 launched T3–T8 in parallel with each agent committing.  
**Problem:** Contaminated atomic commits (T4+T7, T8+T6); hook/type races.  
**Solution:** Orchestrator serializes commits (or defer end-of-feature commit); agents implement+verify only.  
**Prevents:** Mixed task commits during parallel Execute.

### L-004: Parallel Execute without per-task commits still needs shared factory first (2026-07-10)

**Context:** T7 and T8 both needed `makeReviewGenerationService`.  
**Problem:** Parallel agents would race creating the same factory file.  
**Solution:** Orchestrator created the shared factory before launching T7/T8.  
**Prevents:** Duplicate/conflicting factory files during parallel HTTP+worker work.

### L-003: Required body fields break unrelated E2E helpers (2026-07-09)

**Context:** Validation after interview-locale made `interviewLocale` required on interview create/stream.  
**Problem:** `rate-limit-redis` and `token-usage` E2E still sent old payloads → 422 instead of 201.  
**Solution:** Added `interviewLocale: "en"` to create/stream bodies in those suites; grepped remaining E2E helpers.  
**Prevents:** “Feature E2E green, full suite red” after schema tightenings.

### L-001: Required Prisma fields break check-types before callers exist (2026-07-09)

**Context:** T1 added required `interviewLocale` on session models.  
**Problem:** `bun run check-types` failed across repos/fixtures before T6/T11 could wire params.  
**Solution:** Temporary `@default(en)` + create stubs, then replace with real params in T6/T11.  
**Prevents:** Blocking foundation commits on downstream call-site updates; plan stub→wire when schema gates include full tsc.

### L-002: Parallel subagents race git staging (2026-07-09)

**Context:** Multiple agents committing concurrently on the same branch.  
**Problem:** Accidental inclusion of unrelated WIP in commits; Soft-resets needed.  
**Solution:** Each agent stages only its file list; orchestrator serializes commits when paths overlap. User may also defer all commits to end of Execute.  
**Prevents:** Contaminated atomic commits during parallel Execute.

## Open Questions (resolved)

| ID | Question | Status |
|----|----------|--------|
| OQ-01 | Default interview language (PT-BR vs EN)? | **Resolved** — user preference `interviewLocale`; browser bootstrap; non-EN/PT → `en` |
| OQ-02 | Review item similarity threshold for deduplication | Open — propose 0.85 cosine in Design (unrelated feature) |
| OQ-03 | Client payload for `POST .../stream` (message text field name) | Open historically; current API uses `{ content }` / `{ answer }` |

## Preferences

- Grill-me used for disambiguation before Specify on interview-locale and interview-speech-to-text
- Spec-driven Specify used for async-review-items-generation (architecture pre-aligned in chat)
- Prefer single end-of-feature commit over per-task commits when requested
- External providers must stay behind ports/adapters (R2, mailer, LLM generators, STT)
- Lightweight verify/validate tasks are fine on faster/cheaper models
